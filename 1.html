<br> In 2016, ALD opened its first physical retail location on Mott St. in New York's Nolita neighborhood.
<br> The shop quickly developed a reputation for its strong community, evolving interior (which changed with each seasonal collection),
<br> and its mysterious exterior (with curtains hung over the door and street-facing windows).
 <br>In 2017, Aimé Leon Dore collaborated with KITH on hoodies, t-shirts, pullover sailing jackets, pants, and caps
<br> with a nautical theme and anchors, boat paddles, and evil eye iconography inspired by Mykonos.

<p style="margin-top:40px;">In 2019, ALD moved to a larger storefront on nearby Mulberry St, That also has an attached nostalgic coffee shop.
  <br> The new store gave greater expression to the brand's creative vision and included a living-room style interior evoking classic Parisian homes,
  <br> an installation from New York artist Tyrrell Winston, as a well as Café Leon Dore, a Mediterranean coffee shop inspired by Santis' Greek roots with outdoor seating.<br> Jon Caramanica of The New York Times reviewed ALD's Mulberry flagship in his column "Critical Shopper."<br> The piece described ALD as a post-streetwear heritage brand.</p>
